# Quiz App Monolithic 

Built a monolithic application which further breaked down and done a new project with microservices architecture with new repo : https://github.com/bsainath99/quizApp-microservices. 

In this project, I have implemented quiz application using monolithic architecture.

In general, when we say Quiz, a user will get a set of questions whihc are of MCQ type and then based on what we choose, we get a score based on correct answers provided by user.

  To achive that we need set of questions for attemptng the quiz in database say ike 10-15. So, I've used PostgreSQL database for string the questions and other stuff. 
  
   And then, we have a spring boot application. We need to do CRUD operations with Questions. 

 We need multiple layers for getting questions from DB like: 
User --> Controller --> Service --> DAO / Repository.

Repeat the same steps for Quiz as well.

## Features

- CRUD Operations: for both Question and Quiz Services
- PostgreSQL Database: Used PostgreSQL for data storage, with Spring Data JPA for ORM.
- Postman : Used Postman to test every end point 


## Tech Stack

- Java: Programming language for building the application.
- PostgreSQL: Relational database management system for data persistence.
- Spring Boot: Framework for creating the RESTful API.
- Postman: Tool for testing the API endpoints.
